# toDoList
Simple to do list, captures skillset in Html CSS &amp; JavaScript


Learning is one of my greatest passion and desire, over the past few years my perception on programming has changed every new day and this has led to commit myself to even trying out new things, we only become better by engaging, this is the only way to stretch the brain muscle and even pick up new techinques.

The project is a simple to do list, it allows one to add the list of things they would love to a complish for the day, it serves as my first draft which will be as a guide and as well propel me towards achieving the goal of collaborating with others on a bigger scale.
